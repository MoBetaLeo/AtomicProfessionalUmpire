    <center><p>Those who said that this is false are the same people who think that they are entitled to its value. My work is named after this Atomic event and wouldn't even exist had I been lying like those who mean nothing to me are saying that I did for attention. In the entirety of its existence absolutely no one has inquired even one time to seek the truth. I am stating that accepting this as fact is chemically obligatory and that people’s beliefs make no difference to me since I did not place that battery there to deceive anyone. I've received no defense from any PiKapp and will include none of the people who have been hostile due to their assumption that their involvement is beneficial to what I've made when the opposite is true. Not only did I tell the truth about the Origin of Atomic but it has led to the revision of the English language, which resulted in the first time 28 digits of sound have reached 1,000 in gematria and a sport that puts all others in check. Teaching others to play this game isn’t as important as accumulating points because people would not be able unless instructed how to. Its difficult nature would require me to stop gaining my own points and show players how so I would have to be compensated to the degree of value that is equal to the current entertainment industry because I gain points at a rate that is higher than any other athlete in history. No other person is even allowed to copy my work or attempt to call themselves an Umpire unless I am keeping track of their progress through the linear and chronological organization. Nothing that I have been called is important and I will prove that anyone who has been disrespectful is being exactly what they say that I am since they are wrong about this event, don’t even care what really happened even after seven years, but act like this is something that they could be wrong about without consequence and somehow make money off of. I am exactly what I say that I am since I have dates for every title that I use to justify my kingship and I will not be anything but true when it comes to people who choose themselves enough to seek my friendship. My allegiance is to PiKappaPhi, my merit is the Atomic Professional Umpire, and my inheritance is the Fasces. I will hold people who said the wrong answer accountable because they think that they will just reach into my pockets when I have to destroy their argument just to make anything deserving of the worth that is proportional to a legitimate market. I have not/will not change my story one time, my work is vital to every field of study, and my sport is so hard that I just stopped caring about recruitment. I am being harassed by the people that should have been parallel to this from the start and I will deal with the behavior that I am not participating with accordingly. None who have excluded themselves will be welcome and I am telling the lot of them right now that, “I told you so, I am not paying you, and I’ll go to war over this.” The truth will win and I am the one telling it. I don’t care if I do so alone because this struggle is breeding greatness and the people who are just being lazy when it comes to this are just looking for a handout. L-EARN</p></center>

    <center><p>The Origin is True and any who oppose are not. I am real and so I am at peace. I will not back down in relation to people who abuse their power and pretend that they still have any. I've been betrayed by those who swore to defend this truth and me in an instance exactly like this one. There will be nothing but punishment for those who assumed that their involvement in the wrong answer will justify it. I will not support any person that has commited an act of agression thinking that I will pardon them based on a relationship that does not exist due to the nature of the act that was done with disregard for me and the same relationship that they expect me to pretend mattered to them. I am completely serious that nothing done behind my back/in my name will do anything but backfire for the people involved. I get the feeling like my fraternal membership has led to certain individuals gaining access to the sacred information that I am not seeing personified and unless I am proven incorrect those specific people are banned for life because they are trying to prey upon morals that they are not exhibiting. The Origin is real and the sport is for those who care so for that reason none are welcome unless I give permission. I am not a threat to anyone who is chosing not to participate but I will also not support any of those people financially. I wish that people cared about the work that I put into this but the difficulty will seperate the strong from the weak. Those attitudes did nothing but define their choice to exclude themselves and they are free to do so without force since I do not need them to play but they should not expect anything from me unless they put in the time. Truth doesn't convince, it conquers.</p></center>
